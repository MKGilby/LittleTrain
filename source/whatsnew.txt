Todo:
* Make the congratulations map endless: When the engine stops at
  the red-light, another engine (a blue one) comes from right and goes
  away with the wagons. Then the light changes to green, more present appears
  and the train goes to pick them up again. Light changes back to red after
  the engine passes it.
  (This increases the probability to the player listens to the "congrats" music
  in its entirety.)
* EYE-CANDY: When completing a map, during the end of map sfx, the wagons should
  be rushing into the exit with increasing speed.
  (Curtain should be delayed a few secs.)
* Draw a tunnel in the wall piece for the entry/exit point of the blue engine.
